    "This function loads all CSV files from a specified directory and combines them into a single DataFrame. The key preprocessing step is sorting player names alphabetically within each team. This standardization is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Order Invariance**: The order of players in a lineup doesn't matter for prediction purposes - what matters is which five players are on the court together.\n",
    "2. **Consistent Feature Representation**: Sorting ensures that the same lineup will always be represented the same way in the data, regardless of the original order.\n",
    "3. **Model Stability**: This helps the model learn patterns about player combinations rather than specific positions in the data structure.\n",

    "**Why Random Forest?**\n",

    "1. **Handles Non-Linear Relationships**: Basketball performance involves complex interactions between players\n",
    "2. **Feature Importance**: Can identify which players or teams have the most impact on outcomes\n",
    "3. **Robust to Overfitting**: The ensemble nature helps prevent overfitting to specific lineups\n",

    "5. **Handles High Dimensionality**: Can effectively manage many features (players, teams, seasons)\n",

    "The model parameters include:\n",
    "- `n_estimators=300`: Uses 300 decision trees in the ensemble for robust predictions\n",
    "- `max_depth=None`: Allows trees to grow to their full depth for complex patterns\n",
    "- `n_jobs=-1`: Uses all available CPU cores for faster training\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Test Case Generation**: \n",
    "   - Extracts test cases from the test data files\n",
    "   - Each test case includes a home team with 4 known players, an away team with 5 players, and the true fifth player to predict\n",
    "   - Standardizes team names using the mapping dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - For each test case, predicts the top-k players to add to the lineup\n",
    "   - Checks if the true fifth player is in the top-k predictions\n",
    "   - Calculates overall accuracy and season-specific accuracy\n",
    "   - Provides detailed output for each test case\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is comprehensive, breaking down results by season to identify where the model performs well or poorly. Using top-k accuracy is a reasonable metric because in practice, coaches might consider multiple player options rather than a single recommendation.\n",

    "- High accuracy (~90%) on test data from 2007-2015\n",
    "- Lower accuracy (~59%) on unseen data from 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "This performance drop on 2016 data can be attributed to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Shift**: NBA basketball changes over time - playing styles, player movements, and team strategies evolve\n",
    "2. **Limited Training**: The model for 2016 predictions was trained only on recent data (2015)\n",
    "3. **Roster Knowledge**: For 2016, rosters were built from the test data itself, which might be incomplete\n",
    "4. **Player Development**: Players' skills and impacts change over time, and the model may not capture these developments\n",
    "5. **New Players**: Rookies and newly significant players in 2016 would have no history in the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses a pragmatic approach by using two separate models:\n",
    "1. A general model for 2007-2015 predictions\n",
    "2. A \"recent\" model focused on 2015 data for 2016 predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, here are some potential improvements for the model:\n",

    "1. **Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Player statistics (points, rebounds, assists)\n",
    "   - Player positions and roles\n",
    "   - Team playing styles and strategies\n",
    "   - Coach influence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **More Sophisticated Models**:\n",
    "   - Neural networks for capturing complex player interactions\n",
    "   - Time series models to capture trends and player development\n",
    "   - Transfer learning approaches to leverage knowledge across seasons\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - Synthetic data generation for rare player combinations\n",
    "   - Incorporating additional seasons of data\n",
    "   - External data sources (injuries, trades, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensemble Approaches**:\n",
    "   - Combining multiple model types\n",
    "   - Weighting models based on recency of training data\n",
    "   - Specialized models for different types of matchups\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretability Tools**:\n",
    "   - Feature importance analysis\n",
    "   - Partial dependence plots\n",
    "   - SHAP values for explaining individual predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these improvements, the model could potentially achieve higher accuracy on unseen data like the 2016 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA lineup prediction model demonstrates a practical application of machine learning to sports analytics. While achieving high accuracy on data from the same time period as the training data, it struggles with predictions for a new season (2016). This highlights the challenges of predicting in dynamic domains like professional sports, where player movements, team strategies, and game styles evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach of using two separate models - one for historical data and one for recent data - is a reasonable compromise that delivers decent results. However, the accuracy drop on 2016 data suggests that more sophisticated techniques might be needed for truly robust predictions across seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code provides a solid foundation for NBA lineup optimization that could be extended with more advanced features, models, and data sources."
